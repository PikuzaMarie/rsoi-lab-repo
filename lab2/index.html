						<h3>A look into the IDM</h3>
						<div class="text-container">
							<p>
								Radiohead&#39;s album “Kid A” is often hailed as a
								groundbreaking work that significantly influenced the IDM
								(Intelligent Dance Music) genre. Released in 2000, the album
								marked a departure from the band&#39;s earlier rock sound,
								embracing electronic music and experimental elements.
							</p>
							<p>
								Tracks like “Everything in Its Right Place” and “Idioteque”
								showcase the band&#39;s innovative use of synthesizers, drum
								machines, and unconventional song structures. The album&#39;s
								atmospheric and often eerie soundscapes drew inspiration from
								artists like Aphex Twin and Autechre, blending ambient,
								electronic, and jazz influences.
							</p>
							<p>
								“Kid A” challenged listener&#39;s expectations and pushed the
								boundaries of what popular music could be, making it a seminal
								work in the IDM genre. Its impact is still felt today, as it
								continues to inspire musicians and producers exploring the
								intersection of electronic and alternative music
