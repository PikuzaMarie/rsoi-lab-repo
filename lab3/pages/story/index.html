                        <h4>The Viking era</h4>
                        <p>People began settling in Norway very early - in 9000 BC, in fact. 
                            This was after the end of the first ice age, so it was now an inhabitable location. 
                            Settlers survived by hunting and fishing animals such as seal, deer, elk and whales. 
                            Farming didn't become prominent until 500 BC, which was known as the bronze age. 
                            This time period got its name from the various weapons and jewelry created.
